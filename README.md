# convolutional_neural_networks

This repository is a collection of codes I wrote to learn the basics of machine learning algorithms and platforms during my bachelor study. It mainly focused on convolutional neural networks as this part serves as a foundation for classification problems in object detection.


The included technical practices and tools are
- Tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
